# Changelog

All notable changes to Clipman are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — panel-menu UI (GNOME top-bar dropdown)

- The GNOME Shell extension now adds a permanent panel indicator whose
  dropdown lists the recent clipboard history: two-line rows with the
  one-line text preview plus a meta line (relative time, char count for
  text, pixel dimensions for images), a star for pinned entries, a
  masked row with a lock icon for sensitive entries, real image
  thumbnails, click to paste into the focused window, a per-row delete
  button, and footer actions for incognito, clear history and
  preferences. Rows are refetched from the daemon on every open; the
  daemon owns the row limit and all state, the menu is a thin view.
  The `GetHistory` D-Bus signature changed to `a(usstyuus)` (id,
  content type, preview, timestamp, pinned/sensitive flags, char count
  or image width/height, image path), so the extension's
  `metadata.json` version is bumped.
- New daemon D-Bus methods backing the menu: `GetHistory`,
  `ActivateEntry`, `DeleteEntry`, `ClearHistory` and `SetIncognito`.
- The extension ships a `prefs.js`: the GNOME Extensions app (and the
  dropdown's Preferences item, which opens it via
  `org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.OpenExtensionPrefs`) now show a native
  Adwaita settings page for the history and privacy settings, backed by
  new `GetSetting`/`SetSetting` D-Bus methods with a key whitelist.
  The dropdown falls back to the popup window when the shell prefs
  API is unavailable.
- The `Toggle` action (Super+V / `clipman toggle`) now opens the panel
  menu via a new authorized extension `ToggleMenu` method (contract
  version 9) and falls back to the popup window when the extension
  lacks it. The window remains the preferences/management UI.
- `Panel menu history size` preference (1–100, default 30) controls
  how many rows the dropdown lists.

### Fixed — prefs dialog failed to open on GNOME Shell 50

- GNOME Shell 50 moved the extension preferences dialog into the
  shell's D-Bus service and instantiates `new prefsModule.default(...)`
  on the prefs module before calling `fillPreferencesWindow()` on the
  instance; a module that only exported the 45–49 style functions
  failed with `prefsModule.default is not a constructor`. `prefs.js`
  now default-exports the preferences class (GNOME 50 entry point)
  while keeping the `init()`/`fillPreferencesWindow()` function
  exports for GNOME 45–49.

### Fixed — daemon busy-looped at ~100% CPU after showing the popup

- `ClipmanWindow._present_focused()` handed
  `search_entry.grab_focus` straight to `GLib.idle_add()`. GTK's
  `gtk_widget_grab_focus()` returns `TRUE`, and a GLib idle callback
  that returns a truthy value is rescheduled, so the source ran
  forever: from the first time the popup was shown until the daemon
  was restarted, the process spun on a full CPU core while doing
  nothing visible. The deferred focus now goes through a one-shot
  idle callback that returns `False`, and a regression test pins the
  callback's return value.

### Added — developer tooling

- `scripts/deps.sh`: one manifest of system packages (`runtime`, `test`,
  `lint` sets; apt, dnf, pacman). `install.sh` and CI read it; the apt
  list used to be copied by hand into `install.sh`, `test.yml` and
  `release.yml`.
- `scripts/dev-setup.sh`: one-command bootstrap. Installs the system
  packages, creates `.venv` with `--system-site-packages`, installs the
  `dev` extras and the git hooks.
- `scripts/dev.sh`: task runner (`test`, `lint`, `check`, `screenshot`,
  `hooks-test`, …) with an optional `Makefile` wrapper. `dev.sh test` is
  exactly what CI runs.
- `lint`, `test` and `dev` extras in `pyproject.toml` (ruff pinned at
  0.15.13, pytest, PyGObject, dbus-python).

### Fixed — CI ran fewer tests than it reported

- The release workflow's test job installed the GTK 3 typelibs, set no
  `CLIPMAN_REQUIRE_GTK4` and ran without xvfb, so the widget tests were
  skipped on the release-gating run. It now runs the same three steps
  as `test.yml`.
- CI installed `pydbus`, but the app imports `dbus` (dbus-python), so
  `clipman.app` failed to import under the matrix interpreter and
  `test_app.py` skipped (8 tests). The `test` extra installs dbus-python.
- `test_keybindings.py` probed `gi.repository.Gdk` as an attribute,
  which only exists once another module has imported Gdk, so it skipped
  (10 tests) depending on import order. It now imports the submodule.
  Every CI run had reported `OK (skipped=18)`.
- The `toggle` smoke test in `test_entry_point.py` now runs without a
  display and against a dead session bus, so it fails fast instead of
  starting the daemon, and cannot toggle a developer's real one.
- `scripts/install-hooks.sh` no longer blocks on `read` when there is
  no terminal and, without one, only replaces a foreign
  `core.hooksPath` when `--replace` is given.

### Fixed — PyPI and AppImage entry points

- `pip install clipman-clipboard` produced a `clipman` command that failed
  with `ModuleNotFoundError`: the console script pointed at
  `clipman.clipman:main`, which did not exist. The entry point now lives in
  `clipman.cli` (`clipman`, `clipman toggle`, `clipman --version`,
  `python -m clipman`); the checkout script `clipman.py` is a thin shim.
- The wheel and sdist did not include `clipman/style.css`, so a pip install
  would crash on its first window. It is declared as package data, and a
  new CI job builds the wheel, installs it into a clean venv and runs the
  entry point.
- The AppImage entrypoint ran `python -m clipman.app`, which has no
  `__main__` and exited at once; it now runs `python -m clipman`.

### Fixed — sensitive-data detection deleted ordinary clips

- The old rule flagged any single word of 8 to 128 characters that mixed
  three character classes. That covered most URLs, file names with
  digits, timestamps and version strings. Those clips were masked and
  then deleted for good after 30 seconds. On a benchmark of 552 everyday
  clips it flagged 229. It also caught no card numbers, although the
  Preferences text promised it would.
- Detection now lives in `clipman/sensitive.py` and only matches known
  secret shapes: vendor tokens with a unique prefix, private and SSH
  keys, JSON Web Tokens, URLs with a password inside, labelled values
  such as `PASSWORD=...`, `Authorization` headers, card numbers that pass
  Luhn, TOTP seeds and a few command lines that take a password inline.
  On the same benchmark it flags 0 of 552 everyday clips and catches 129
  of 165 secrets. A bare password with no label is not detected on
  purpose: it looks the same as a Wi-Fi name or a licence key.
- New Privacy switch "Auto-clear sensitive clips" (on by default). When
  off, detected clips stay masked but are never deleted.
- The benchmark corpus ships as `tests/sensitive_corpus.py` and
  `tests/test_sensitive.py` asserts zero false positives on it.

### Fixed — daemon start-up and incognito on the bus

- A second daemon was never refused the `com.clipman.Daemon` name. It
  waited in the bus queue, and the code that should have logged and
  quit never ran. The name is now requested with `do_not_queue`, so a
  second daemon exits at once. A new test starts two daemons on a
  private bus and checks that the second one is refused.
- When the session bus could not be reached, the error escaped the
  start-up code as a traceback while the window kept the process
  alive. The daemon now logs the error and quits.
- Incognito mode also pauses the GNOME Shell extension (contract v8) so
  clips never cross the bus while it is on. The daemon calls
  `SetPaused` when incognito changes, at start-up, and again whenever
  the extension reappears. Older extensions ignore the call.
- Reading an image from the clipboard ran `wl-paste` on the main loop
  and could freeze the popup for up to five seconds. It now runs on a
  background thread and stores the result on the main loop.
### Fixed — storage and update check

- A `max_entries` setting stored as a float string (for example
  `500.0`) made every copy fail with `ValueError`. The value is now
  parsed the same way the Preferences pane reads it.
- The database file itself was created with the process umask (0644
  on most systems); only the directory and the WAL side files were
  0600. It is now clamped to 0600 on every start, as the FAQ said.
- The update check wrote its result to SQLite from a background
  thread. It now hands the result to the GLib main loop first, so all
  database access stays on one thread.
- Comparing a release tag that is not a valid version (for example
  `1.2.3-hotfix`) against a valid one could raise inside the update
  check. Both sides now fall back to the same simple comparison.
- `update_entry_text` had no caller and could break the unique hash
  constraint; removed. `get_latest_text` returns the newest text clip
  regardless of pins, for the `${clipboard}` snippet token.

### Fixed — popup window

- The Images tab could show "no images" while its badge counted some:
  the list loaded the 200 newest clips of any type and filtered them in
  Python. The Text and Images tabs now ask the database for that type.
- The `${clipboard}` snippet token expanded to the top *pinned* clip,
  not the newest one. It now uses the newest text clip.
- The "Snap notes" button opened a page that did not exist. It now
  opens the install section of the README.
- After the popup copied a clip, the monitor skipped the next clipboard
  change with no time limit, so it could swallow a real copy made
  later. The skip now expires after two seconds.
- Links from the popup go through the same http(s)-only opener as the
  Preferences window. The "Reveal folder" button uses its own helper
  that only opens folders that exist.
- Paste through the GNOME Shell extension: a failed focus restore no
  longer aborts the paste; an old extension that rejects the mode
  argument gets the no-argument call that ADR 0005 promised; and when
  the extension refuses both calls the popup comes back with a
  "Couldn't auto-paste" dialog instead of falling back to wtype, which
  cannot inject keys on Mutter.
- Masked rows say only "Sensitive" when "Auto-clear sensitive clips"
  is off, instead of counting down to a purge that will not happen.

### Fixed — packaging and release scripts

- `scripts/update-aur.sh` wrote a hard-coded `.SRCINFO` that listed
  `gtk3` and no `libadwaita`, so every release pushed a GTK 3 dependency
  list for a GTK 4 app to AUR. It now builds `.SRCINFO` from `PKGBUILD`
  and also refreshes the tarball hash in the Flatpak manifest.
  `--print-srcinfo` prints the result for the tests.
- `aur/PKGBUILD` and `aur/.SRCINFO` still carried the 1.0.6 tarball hash
  (and `.SRCINFO` said 1.1.0). Regenerated for 1.2.1.
- `aur/PKGBUILD` installed the systemd unit with the literal
  `CLIPMAN_PATH_PLACEHOLDER` in `ExecStart`. It now gets the same path
  substitution as the desktop file.
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` adds an empty `<release>` entry to both
  metainfo files and prints the release steps from AGENTS.md (release
  PR, tag through the GitHub API, then `update-aur.sh`) instead of
  `git push --tags`, which the pre-push hook rejects.
- The Flatpak manifest lacked `--own-name` for `com.clipman.Daemon` and
  `com.clipman.Clipman`, so the daemon could not take its bus names
  inside the sandbox.
- The snap no longer copies the whole checkout (docs, tests, CI files)
  into the package; only the runtime files, the licence and the notice
  ship.
- New `tests/test_release_metadata.py`: the version must be the same in
  every packaging file, `.SRCINFO` must match `PKGBUILD`, and AUR and
  Flatpak must pin the same tarball hash.

### Fixed — release workflow and CI

- The GitHub Release was marked Latest even when the PyPI or Snap
  publish job had failed; the AUR push then followed. The release job
  now needs every publish job to succeed. A dispatch re-run skips wheels
  that are already on PyPI instead of failing.
- The `.deb` and `.rpm` declared GTK 3 dependencies (`gir1.2-gtk-3.0`,
  `gtk3`) for a GTK 4 app. They now depend on GTK 4 and libadwaita.
- The pre-flight check compared the tag with `pyproject.toml` and the
  snap only. It now checks every file that carries the version
  (`_version.py`, `CITATION.cff`, `PKGBUILD`, `.SRCINFO`, the Flatpak
  manifest, both metainfo files) and requires a matching CHANGELOG
  section.
- The AUR job checked out the default branch on a manual dispatch, so it
  could publish main's files under a release tag. It checks out the tag.
- The dispatch input `tag` was expanded straight into a shell script; it
  is now read through the environment and must look like `vX.Y.Z`. The
  same env pass-through is used in the baseline guard's issue body and
  the branch-cleanup job.
- The apt steps in the release, lint and extension-bundle jobs now have a
  step timeout and retries, like the test job.
- The security-baseline update raced when two merges landed close
  together: the loser's push was rejected and the baseline went stale.
  It now rebases and retries, and keeps the remote baseline when that
  one comes from a newer commit.
- `snap-refresh` fails clearly when the latest release tag cannot be
  resolved, instead of risking a build of main on the stable channel.
- ruff also lints `scripts/` and the root `clipman.py`. Two jobs moved
  from `ubuntu-latest` to the pinned `ubuntu-24.04`. Issue templates use
  the `type:bug` and `type:feature` labels that `labels.yml` defines.

### Fixed — install and uninstall scripts

- `install.sh` replaced GNOME's whole "toggle message tray" shortcut
  list with `['<Super>m']` to free Super+V. It now removes only
  `<Super>v` and keeps the user's other keys. The original list is saved
  so `uninstall.sh` can put it back; before, uninstall reset the key to
  GNOME's default.
- `install.sh` installed the icon but no desktop entry, so the Clipman
  window had no name or icon in the dash and in Alt+Tab. It now installs
  `com.clipman.Clipman.desktop` (with the install path filled in) into
  `~/.local/share/applications`; `uninstall.sh` removes it.

### Fixed — git hooks

- The trailer-identity check never ran. It read the output of
  `git interpret-trailers --parse` as a tab-separated pair, but that
  command prints `Key: value`, so every trailer was skipped and the
  function always reported success. AI co-author trailers were still
  blocked, by the footprint scanner. The parser now splits on the first
  colon.
- With the check live, its old policy rejected every raw personal or
  work domain, which would have blocked outside contributors'
  `Signed-off-by` and `Reviewed-by` trailers. The repo's own test corpus
  requires those to pass. The policy now rejects only two things: an
  AI-assistant vendor domain, and a trailer whose display name borrows
  the maintainer's handle on an address that does not back it up.
- The push-URL check matched the allowlist as a substring of the whole
  URL, so a repo such as `attacker/<owner>-mirror.git` passed. It now
  compares the owner segment of the URL exactly, and falls back to the
  old check for remotes with no host, such as local paths.
- `.githooks/_test.sh` is clean under shellcheck, and `scripts/dev.sh
  shellcheck` now covers the hooks as well. The suite went from one
  failing case out of 43 to 51 of 51, with new cases for impersonation,
  an AI vendor domain and the push-URL owner match.

### Fixed — translations and the snippets editor

- Translation extraction covered one file. `po/POTFILES.in` listed only
  `window.py`, so 155 of the 226 translatable strings never reached the
  template: the whole Preferences pane, every edge state and the
  snippets editor. All four modules are listed now and the template
  holds every string.
- New `scripts/dev.sh i18n` rebuilds the template through
  `scripts/gen-pot.py` and compiles any `po/*.po` into `locale/`. It
  extracts with `pygettext`, which ships with CPython, so regenerating
  needs no extra package; compiling needs `msgfmt`, which is now part
  of the `dev` dependency set. `install.sh` compiles catalogues too, so
  a source install picks up a language once one is contributed.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/translating.md` told contributors to
  write `from clipman import _`, which is the cyclic import the CodeQL
  gate rejects. Both now say `from gettext import gettext as _`, and
  the string counts and the `.mo` status they quoted are current.
- The snippets editor wrote an empty "New snippet" row as soon as
  "New" was pressed, so cancelling left it behind. "New" now opens an
  unsaved draft and nothing is written until Save, which stays
  insensitive until the name is filled in.
- Deleting a snippet asked nothing. It now confirms first, like
  clearing the history does.

### Fixed — test suite side effects

- Running the tests opened a file manager on the developer's desktop.
  An edge-state action reached the real `xdg-open` with a temp
  directory the test had already deleted, and another asked systemd to
  restart the real daemon. The widget tests now share a fixture that
  stubs the functions reaching outside the process, and two leaked
  child processes are gone with it.
- Every widget test built its window on an application that had not
  emitted `startup`, so each one logged a `Gtk-CRITICAL`. The shared
  fixture registers the application first. The suite is silent now.

### Fixed — documentation that did not match the code

A sweep of every claim in the docs against the code. The corrections that
change what a reader would do:

- README documented a "Shift+Enter — copy without pasting" shortcut in
  two tables and sent people to it from the troubleshooting section. No
  such shortcut exists: Enter is handled with no modifier check.
  Troubleshooting now points at the Paste behaviour setting, which is
  the real answer for editor terminals.
- README told people to click a "+ Add" button to create a snippet and
  an "Edit snippets" button to open the editor. Neither label exists;
  the control is the "+" button in the header bar, shown only on the
  Snippets tab. README also listed a "Check now" button in the Updates
  pane that is not there.
- `docs/development.md` documented a `CLIPMAN_DATA_DIR` environment
  variable. Nothing reads it; the data directory is fixed.
- The site and the two LLM summaries told people to run
  `pipx install clipman-clipboard`. That produces a launcher which
  cannot start, because the GTK4 bindings are distro packages a plain
  virtualenv cannot see. They now use `--system-site-packages` and say
  why.
- Three release documents said to publish with `git push --tags`. The
  identity pre-push hook rejects a tag that points at one of GitHub's
  squash commits, so the tag has to be created through the GitHub API.
  The release checklist now walks through the release PR and the API
  call, and its rollback advice does the same.
- The release documents also listed the wrong files for
  `scripts/bump-version.sh` (naming `clipman/__init__.py`, which it has
  never touched, and omitting four it does), described the AUR push as
  a manual step that the pipeline has automated, pointed at two ADR
  filenames that do not exist, and named the wrong AUR remote.
- `docs/llms-full.txt` claimed FTS5 search, image storage under
  `blobs/`, and a daemon that refuses to start on loose permissions.
  Search is SQL `LIKE`, images live under `images/`, and the daemon
  repairs permissions rather than refusing.
- The AppImage instructions asked for `gir1.2-gtk-3.0` for a GTK 4 app.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` opened with raw TOML that rendered as body text,
  and its reporting address was still the template's
  `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]`, while `GOVERNANCE.md` said a channel
  existed. It now names the private advisory channel that
  `SECURITY.md` uses.
- The two AppStream metainfo files had drifted: one was missing the
  1.0.5 and 1.0.6 releases, and they disagreed on the date and summary
  of 1.0.4. Both now match the CHANGELOG.
- Counts and names that had gone stale: the test total and per-file
  breakdown, the edge-state count, the translation-template size, the
  light palette (warm stone, not Catppuccin Latte), the preferences
  widget (`Adw.Dialog`, not `Adw.PreferencesWindow`), the GNOME Shell
  range, the site's version strings, the sitemap dates, and the
  versions shown in the design mockups.
- `SECURITY.md` now states the support window, which the contributor
  guide requires it to carry. `docs/ci-cd.md` claimed a complete
  workflow inventory while missing two workflows and one secret.
- `pyproject.toml` gained per-version classifiers so the tested range
  is visible on PyPI. `requires-python` stays open at the top end, so a
  newer interpreter is still allowed to install.

### Added — two superseding ADRs

- **ADR 0011** supersedes ADR 0010. The versioning policy is unchanged,
  but four of its premises were stale: the Ubuntu baseline, the toolkit
  (GTK 4 shipped in 1.1.0), the file the bump script patches, and a
  D-Bus contract list missing two of the extension's four methods.
- **ADR 0012** supersedes ADR 0009. The snap moved to `core24` with the
  GNOME extension, so the GTK stack comes from Canonical's content snap
  instead of being restaged from the archive, and the weekly job now
  refreshes every channel rather than only edge.

### Security — GNOME Shell extension (metadata version 8)

- The extension's D-Bus methods (`SimulatePaste`, `MoveWindowToCursor`,
  `RestorePreviousFocus`) could be called by any process on the session
  bus, including through the Shell's own bus name. They could type a
  paste keystroke into the focused window or focus any window by title.
  Every method now accepts calls only from the connection that owns
  `com.clipman.Daemon`; other callers get `AccessDenied`.
- `MoveWindowToCursor` matched windows by title alone. It now requires
  the popup's `wm_class`, the daemon's pid and the title. Windows it
  hides from Alt+Tab on GNOME 49+ are shown again when the extension is
  disabled.
- New `SetPaused(b)` method: while paused the extension does not read
  the clipboard, so incognito can stop clips before they cross the bus.
- Lifecycle fixes: null-prototype recipe tables (a `__proto__` mode no
  longer throws), one virtual keyboard instead of one per paste,
  modifiers are always released, `disable()` clears every reference and
  cancels in-flight work, and the Alt+Tab/dash patches are installed
  only on GNOME 45 to 48 where the real API is missing.
- Clips longer than the daemon's 10 MB limit are no longer sent over the
  bus; delivery failures are logged.
- `scripts/extension-smoke.sh` checks the access rule on a real session.
- Docs: `docs/dbus-api.md` lists all four methods and version 8,
  `docs/threat-model.md` covers the extension surface.

### Changed — Snap packaging (#237, #238)

- The snap now uses the `gnome` extension: the GTK4/libadwaita runtime
  (GTK 4.18 / libadwaita 1.7) comes from Canonical's `gnome-46-2404`
  content snap instead of being staged from the Ubuntu archive. This
  removes the `libadwaita → libappstream → libcurl` dependency tail
  that made every curl security update trip the Snap Store's daily
  scan (three "outdated Ubuntu packages" emails in five weeks), shrinks
  the snap to ~13 MB, and hands GTK-stack security rebuilds to
  Canonical. Only `wtype` and the from-source `wl-clipboard` remain
  first-party payload.
- The weekly snap rebuild now refreshes every published channel —
  stable/candidate/beta are rebuilt from the latest release tag, edge
  from main — so store security notices self-resolve within a week
  with no manual action.

### Changed — CI

- `test.yml`, `lint.yml` and the release test job install system
  packages via `scripts/deps.sh` and run the suite via
  `scripts/dev.sh test`, so a local run and CI are the same command.
  The apt step is capped at four minutes; apt retries with a 30 s fetch
  timeout so a stalled mirror fails inside the cap. The last red run on
  `main` was an apt stall that consumed the whole job budget.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-22

A polish release driven by a full four-dimension audit (docs, code, UI,
repo meta): every public claim re-aligned with the shipped product, the
two GTK deprecations removed, the update banner made dismissable, and
the UI brought to full parity with the design mockups. Rebuilding the
snap also pulls the patched libcurl from USN-8651-1.

### Added — GNOME Shell 49 & 50 support (#186)

- The Shell extension (v7) now declares support for GNOME Shell 49 and
  50, covering Ubuntu 26.04 LTS. No code changes were needed: every API
  the extension touches was verified unchanged against the Shell 49
  headers and Mutter 50.0 (the 49/50 porting guides confirm none of the
  removals — Meta.Rectangle constructors, Clutter.ClickAction, the X11
  backend — intersect the extension's Wayland-native surface). On 49+
  the popup is additionally hidden from the dash and Alt+Tab via the
  supported `Meta.Window.hide_from_window_list()` API, which the code
  already feature-detected.

### Fixed

- **The update banner can now be dismissed** (#231). `updates.dismiss()`
  existed but nothing called it — the bare `Adw.Banner` has no dismiss
  control, so once a release was out the banner reappeared on every
  launch. The notice is now a custom banner row (icon · title/desc ·
  action · dismiss X) and the X persists the dismissal per version.
- Backup/restore use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead of the deprecated
  `Gtk.FileChooserNative`; thumbnails use `Gdk.MemoryTexture` instead of
  the deprecated `Gdk.Texture.new_for_pixbuf` (#229). Zero deprecation
  warnings in the test suite.

### Changed — UI parity with the design mockups (#231)

- Header and footer sit on the raised mantle surface; status-page icons
  are tinted per tone; privacy states (paused pill, incognito banner)
  use the mockup's lavender instead of warning amber; the search field
  rests recessed and raises on focus; image thumbnails get rounded
  corners; filter tabs left-aligned; Preferences gains an "In-popup
  shortcuts" reference group. README screenshots retaken from this
  build (`scripts/screenshot.py --theme/--incognito`).

### Documentation (#226, #230)

- Truth sweep: marketing-site install commands fixed (they referenced
  nonexistent v1.1.0 asset names), the privacy FAQ now accurately
  describes the optional once-daily update check, README/llms.txt
  describe the shipped preferences dialog/palettes/list implementation,
  test counts and support tables refreshed, `CITATION.cff` auto-bumped
  by `bump-version.sh`.
- New `AGENTS.md`: tool-agnostic working guide (workflow, verification
  recipes, platform gotchas, release chain) for AI-assisted development.

### CI (#227)

- Bot workflows use job-scoped token permissions, commit-SHA-pinned
  actions and the harden-runner first step (OpenSSF Scorecard
  Token-Permissions fix).

### Compatibility

Unchanged from 1.2.0 otherwise: Python 3.10–3.12, GNOME Shell 45–50,
Wayland. No D-Bus contract changes; no database migrations. The GNOME
Shell extension remains at v7 (no upload needed).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Highlights

The GTK 4 line is now **stable** — this release closes out the
post-rewrite stabilization tracker (#132) and removes the "use v1.0.6"
advisory. Three fronts landed since 1.1.0: true **Win+V behaviour on
GNOME Wayland**, a **~60× faster list**, and a **full redesign to the
project's design mockups**.

### Fixed — Wayland/Win+V parity (#141, #149, #156)

- The popup now takes real input focus on GNOME Wayland: buttons, search
  and keyboard work; clicking outside dismisses it; it stays out of the
  dash/dock and Alt+Tab; Escape closes; paste lands in the previously
  focused app (keystrokes are injected by the Shell extension — `wtype`
  cannot inject on Mutter — and the clipboard is set via `wl-copy`,
  since a background `Gdk.Clipboard.set()` silently fails).
- The installer launches the daemon once (systemd user service only);
  the duplicate XDG autostart that raced for the D-Bus name is gone.
- Incognito is one persistent state across the header toggle, footer
  pill and Privacy switch — "off" survives restarts (previously stale
  state could silently stop recording).

### Performance (#150)

- Opening the popup and switching filters no longer freezes: rows are
  lightweight widgets (~5× cheaper than `Adw.ActionRow`), image
  thumbnails are decoded once and cached, and long histories stream in
  incrementally. Measured on a real 263-entry history: back-to-All
  refresh ~3.4 s → ~51 ms.

### Changed — redesign to the design mockups (#151, #153–#155, #159)

- Colour-coded type icons (text/link/code/image/snippet) with
  conservative code/URL detection; per-type row metadata (domain for
  links, size + dimensions for images, "Code" tag, snippet use-counts).
- Day-grouped history (★ Pinned / Today / Yesterday / Earlier) with a
  gold pinned group; hover-revealed row actions; sensitive entries are
  masked with a lock icon and an auto-clear countdown.
- Segmented filter switcher (All / Text / Images / Snippets) with live
  count badges; search field with a `/` shortcut hint; footer with item
  count, Recording/Paused pill and Clear all.
- Preferences rebuilt with a left sidebar (matches the mockup), an
  accent colour picker with contrast-aware foreground, and a generic
  font colour picker replacing the fixed presets.
- Light mode is the mockups' high-contrast "stone" palette — every
  text/background pair now clears WCAG AA (the muted Catppuccin Latte
  text was failing it); with the Catppuccin toggle off, the popup
  follows the system GNOME light/dark preference.
- All 19 design edge states are implemented and reachable, including
  guided first-run/extension setup, watcher-crashed, clipboard-blocked,
  shortcut-failed and a database-error screen; banners carry a
  description line and a dismiss button.

### Compatibility

Toolchain floors unchanged from 1.1.0 (GTK 4 ≥ 4.10, libadwaita ≥ 1.4,
Python 3.10–3.12, GNOME Shell 45–48). No D-Bus contract changes. SQLite
schema gains an additive `snippets.use_count` column via automatic
migration — downgrades to 1.1.0 remain safe.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-25

### Highlights

The full **GTK 3 → GTK 4 + libadwaita** port lands in this release.
The popup, the settings surface, the snippets editor, and every edge
state were rebuilt from the ground up against modern Adwaita widgets,
and the Catppuccin palette is now applied as a `@named-color`
overlay so the entire UI picks up the theme without per-widget CSS.
No D-Bus contracts changed (`com.clipman.Daemon` and
`org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.clipman` are byte-identical), the SQLite
schema is unchanged, and no settings keys were renamed — per
[ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-versioning-policy.md) this is a MINOR
release, not a MAJOR. Existing users keep their history,
preferences, and snippets.

### Compatibility

- **Toolkit floor:** GTK 4 ≥ 4.10 and libadwaita ≥ 1.4. Ubuntu 22.04
  no longer ships a recent-enough libadwaita; the supported baseline
  is **Ubuntu 24.04+** (or any distro with libadwaita 1.4 in its
  default repos).
- **Python:** 3.10 – 3.12 (unchanged).
- **GNOME Shell:** 45 – 48 (unchanged).
- **Extension `metadata.json` version:** 5 (unchanged — no D-Bus
  signature changes).

### Install / upgrade

| Channel | Command |
|---------|---------|
| **PyPI** | `pip install --upgrade clipman-clipboard` |
| **Snap** | auto-refresh, or `snap refresh clipman` |
| **AUR** | `yay -S clipman-clipboard` (or `paru -S clipman-clipboard`) |
| **Source** | `git pull && ./install.sh` |

### Changed (UI / runtime)

- **GTK 3 → GTK 4 + libadwaita.** Every UI module was reworked:
  - `clipman/window.py` is now an `Adw.ApplicationWindow` with an
    `Adw.HeaderBar` and an `Adw.ActionRow`-driven history list.
  - `clipman/preferences.py` extracts settings out of the popup into
    a dedicated `Adw.PreferencesWindow` with **six panes** —
    Appearance, Privacy, Shortcuts, Storage, Updates, About — replacing
    the cramped inline settings panel from 1.0.x.
  - `clipman/snippets_dialog.py` ships the snippets editor as an
    `Adw.NavigationSplitView` master-detail dialog, with a searchable
    list on the left and an editor form (template variables
    included) on the right.
  - `clipman/edge_states.py` declares **16 `StateSpec` entries** for
    the empty, no-results, incognito, sensitive-cleared, first-run,
    extension-missing, backup-failed, and other edge states, all
    dispatched at render time by `render_edge_state` into one of
    `Adw.StatusPage`, `Adw.Banner`, or `Adw.AlertDialog`. The state
    set matches the design-workspace mockups one-to-one.
- **Catppuccin palette overlay.** `clipman/style.css` now overrides
  libadwaita's `@named-color` tokens (`@accent_color`,
  `@window_bg_color`, `@card_bg_color`, …) with Catppuccin Mocha for
  dark and Catppuccin Latte for light, so every Adwaita surface
  picks up the theme automatically — no per-widget CSS rules
  required. Matches the marketing mockup exactly.
- **Version literal** moved out of `clipman/__init__.py` into a leaf
  module `clipman/_version.py` to break a cyclic-import path that
  CodeQL was flagging as `py/cyclic-import`. The public
  `clipman.__version__` API is unchanged (`__init__.py` re-exports
  from `_version`) and `scripts/bump-version.sh` patches the literal
  in its new home.

### Internal / packaging

- `install.sh`, `snap/snapcraft.yaml`, and `aur/PKGBUILD` already
  declare GTK 4 + libadwaita dependencies (`gir1.2-gtk-4.0`,
  `gir1.2-adw-1`, `libadwaita-1-0` on Debian/Ubuntu; `gtk4`,
  `libadwaita` on Arch; `gtk4`, `libadwaita` stage-packages on
  snap). The lockstep bump landed in `#83` ahead of the code port.
- `pyproject.toml` `project.description` now reads "A Wayland-native
  clipboard history manager built with GTK 4 and libadwaita".

### Documentation

- `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `docs/index.html`, `docs/llms.txt`, and `docs/llms-full.txt`
  refreshed to describe the new UI surface (Adw widgets, six-pane
  preferences, snippets dialog, 16 edge states, Catppuccin overlay)
  and the new toolkit floor (Ubuntu 24.04 / GTK 4 + libadwaita 1.4).
- AppStream metainfo files (`data/com.clipman.Clipman.metainfo.xml`,
  `data/io.github.MohammedEl_sayedAhmed.Clipman.metainfo.xml`) gain
  a `<release version="1.1.0">` entry describing the port.

### Documentation (carried over from the 1.0.6 → 1.1.0 cycle)

A comprehensive nine-PR documentation overhaul (PRs #40 through #48)
landed during the 1.0.6 → 1.1.0 cycle, alongside the toolkit port.
The release pipeline, install channels, and runtime behavior were
not affected by these docs PRs.

- `docs/adr/0010-versioning-policy.md` — codifies SemVer 2.0.0 with
  clipman-specific MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH triggers (D-Bus contracts on
  `com.clipman.Daemon` and `org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.clipman`,
  SQLite schema breaks, supported Python and GNOME Shell ranges,
  settings-key renames, the `~/.local/share/clipman/` data-dir
  layout, and the GTK3→GTK4 toolkit choice).
- `docs/maintaining.md` — the maintainer playbook: release flow,
  branch hygiene, Dependabot triage, GHAS handling, AUR/Snap channel
  notes.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — top-level walkthrough of the daemon ↔ extension
  split, the D-Bus surface, the SQLite store, and the popup window.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — project governance, decision-making, and the role
  of ADRs.
- `docs/translating.md` — how to add a new locale and run the
  translation toolchain.
- `docs/dbus-api.md` — full reference for both D-Bus interfaces with
  signatures, semantics, and worked `gdbus call` examples.
- `docs/threat-model.md` — STRIDE-style threat model covering the
  clipboard surface, IPC, on-disk storage, and the update checker
  from ADR 0007.
- `docs/ci-cd.md` — workflow-by-workflow inventory of
  `.github/workflows/`, the release-pipeline DAG, the secrets matrix,
  and the SHA-pinning policy reference.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — refreshed contributor entry point that links
  the new docs together and points first-timers at the right place.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-20

### Highlights

A follow-up release that lands everything 1.0.5 was meant to bring
plus the UI polish and packaging breadth the maintainer requested
after seeing the first cut.

**For users**, 1.0.6 supersedes 1.0.5 wherever 1.0.5 actually reached
(Snap Store stable). PyPI and the GitHub Release page reach this
codebase here for the first time — the 1.0.5 publish pipeline failed
mid-way and was retried as 1.0.6.

**New on top of 1.0.5:**

- Three additional release artifacts shipped to the GitHub Release:
  `.deb` (Debian / Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE), and an
  AppImage (best-effort, Linux-portable). PyPI wheel + sdist, Snap
  stable, and the GNOME Shell extension zip are unchanged from 1.0.5.
- Settings panel restructured into five clearly-labelled sections
  (**APPEARANCE / HISTORY / SHORTCUTS / UPDATES / DATA**). The Updates
  row no longer crams its switch + status + button onto one line.
- Comprehensive visual overhaul of the popup CSS — accent-coloured
  slider thumbs on slim tracks, refined buttons with bigger touch
  targets, theme as a proper segmented control, larger colour
  swatches, custom switch styling, more breathing room everywhere.
- Chrome font sizes raised across the board so labels, section
  headers, and buttons are legible on standard-DPI displays (the
  earlier overhaul had drifted to 8-11 px; now 10-14 px depending
  on the role).
- A subtle but important fix: clicking certain settings widgets on
  some Wayland compositors used to silently swallow the click. The
  `focus-out-event` handler now distinguishes between losing focus
  to another window (still hides) and losing focus to a child of
  the popup itself (no-op). Affected the Switch, the combo box, and
  the shortcut-capture dialog.

### Compatibility

Unchanged from 1.0.5: GNOME Shell 45 – 48, Python 3.10 – 3.12,
extension `metadata.json` version 5.

### Install / upgrade

| Channel | Command |
|---------|---------|
| **PyPI** | `pip install --upgrade clipman-clipboard` |
| **Snap** | auto-refresh, or `snap refresh clipman` |
| **AUR** | `yay -S clipman` (or `paru -S clipman`) |
| **Source** | `git pull && ./install.sh` |
| **`.deb` (Debian / Ubuntu)** | grab `clipman_1.0.6_all.deb` from the GitHub Release → `sudo apt install ./clipman_1.0.6_all.deb` |
| **`.rpm` (Fedora / RHEL)** | grab `clipman-1.0.6-1.noarch.rpm` from the GitHub Release → `sudo dnf install ./clipman-1.0.6-1.noarch.rpm` |
| **AppImage** | grab `clipman-1.0.6-x86_64.AppImage` → `chmod +x` → run. Still needs system `python3-gi` and `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`. |
| **GNOME Extension** | re-run `install.sh`, or upload the attached `clipman-extension-v1.0.6.zip` at <https://extensions.gnome.org/upload/> |

### Changed
- Release pipeline: `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` now pinned to the
  *commit* SHA rather than the annotated-tag-object SHA. The previous
  pin caused the v1.0.5 PyPI publish to fail with "Unable to find
  image" because Docker-based actions resolve the image tag from the
  ref. `snapcore/action-{build,publish}` fixed for consistency.
- `softprops/action-gh-release` no longer fails when the AppImage
  glob doesn't match (`fail_on_unmatched_files: false`). AppImage
  packaging for a Python+GTK app is intentionally best-effort.
- CodeQL workflow: per-SHA concurrency group on `push` events so
  rapid back-to-back merges to `main` no longer drop the queued
  `update-baseline` job. `workflow_dispatch` added as a manual
  escape hatch.

### Internal / CI
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: new `build-distpkgs` job (fpm-based
  .deb + .rpm) and new `build-appimage` job (python-appimage-based).
  Release body now carries a templated **Assets** table with use
  case + channel + install caveats per artifact.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-20

### Highlights

The first release with **customizable keyboard shortcuts** and an
**in-app update checker**. Two long-standing community requests
(issues [#4](https://github.com/MohammedEl-sayedAhmed/clipman/issues/4)
and [#7](https://github.com/MohammedEl-sayedAhmed/clipman/issues/7))
are addressed: pick any combo to open Clipman, pick how it sends the
paste keystroke (Auto / Ctrl+V / Ctrl+Shift+V / Shift+Insert).

Under the hood, this release also ships the entire CI/security and
release-automation overhaul — Dependabot, CodeQL with a
hash-stable baseline ratchet, OpenSSF Scorecard, secret scanning,
gitleaks, a tag-triggered release pipeline (PyPI via OIDC, Snap
stable, GitHub Release, extension bundle), weekly snap rebuilds for
Ubuntu security updates, and a documentation sweep covering nine
ADRs, a development guide, and a release runbook. See the full
breakdown below.

### Install / upgrade

| Channel | Command |
|---------|---------|
| **PyPI** | `pip install --upgrade clipman-clipboard` |
| **Snap** | auto-refreshes, or `snap refresh clipman` |
| **AUR** | `yay -S clipman` (or `paru -S clipman`) |
| **Source** | `git pull && ./install.sh` |
| **GNOME Extension** | re-run `install.sh`, or upload the attached `clipman-extension-v1.0.5.zip` at <https://extensions.gnome.org/upload/> |

### Compatibility

- **GNOME Shell** 45, 46, 47, 48 (extension `metadata.json` is at
  version 5 — `SimulatePaste(s mode)`; the daemon retries
  no-arg automatically against an unupgraded v4 extension).
- **Python** 3.10 – 3.12 (tested on `ubuntu-24.04`).

### Added
- Customizable toggle shortcut from the settings panel. Click the
  shortcut button to capture a new key combination; the daemon writes
  it to GNOME's custom keybinding via gsettings. Default unchanged
  (`Super+V`). Closes #4.
- Customizable paste keystroke from the settings panel: `Auto-detect`
  (default — Ctrl+V, switches to Ctrl+Shift+V for terminals),
  `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, or `Shift+Insert`. Closes #7.
- `clipman/keybindings.py` module with gsettings shell-out helpers
  and a 30-test unit suite (`tests/test_keybindings.py`).
- **In-app update notifications.** Daemon polls GitHub Releases
  anonymously once per day; the settings panel gains an "Updates"
  row (status / opt-out switch / "Check now" button) and the popup
  surfaces a dismissible banner when a newer release is detected.
  Default ON for source / PyPI / AUR, OFF for Snap and Flatpak
  (they auto-refresh). New `clipman/updates.py` module with a
  38-test unit suite (`tests/test_updates.py`). `__version__`
  constant added to `clipman/__init__.py` as the runtime source of
  truth; `scripts/bump-version.sh` keeps it in sync with
  `pyproject.toml`. `network` plug added to `snap/snapcraft.yaml`
  for the opt-in path. See [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-in-app-update-notifications.md).

### Changed
- GNOME Shell extension D-Bus interface: `SimulatePaste()` now
  accepts an optional `s mode` argument. The daemon falls back to
  the no-arg signature for older extension builds, so the new
  daemon remains compatible with an unupgraded extension.
- `extension/metadata.json`: bumped to version 5.

### Internal / CI

#### Added
- **CI/security baseline** (#8): Dependabot for `pip` and
  `github-actions` (weekly, labeled `dependencies`/`python`/`ci`);
  CodeQL for Python and JavaScript with the `security-and-quality`
  suite (weekly + on PR/push); ruff on `clipman/` and `tests/`;
  shellcheck on `install.sh`/`uninstall.sh`/`launcher.sh`; gitleaks
  secret scan on PR/push; `SECURITY.md` with the private-disclosure
  policy; PR template + issue forms (bug, feature, and a config that
  routes security reports through GitHub Security Advisories).
- **Weekly Snap Store rebuild** (#9): `snap-refresh.yml` rebuilds and
  re-publishes the Snap on a weekly cron so the published artifact
  always carries the latest security patches for its base + python
  layer, even when no code changed in this repo.
- **Tag-triggered release automation** (#16): `release.yml` builds
  and publishes a tagged release end-to-end — pre-flight sanity
  checks (tag matches `pyproject.toml` and `snap/snapcraft.yaml`,
  CHANGELOG has a matching section), full test matrix
  (Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12), PyPI publish via OIDC trusted
  publishing (no long-lived token), Snap publish to the stable
  channel, versioned GNOME extension bundle, and a GitHub Release
  with all artifacts attached and the body extracted from
  `CHANGELOG.md`. See `docs/releases/README.md` and ADR 0004.
- **CodeQL security-baseline ratchet** (#17): a PR fails CodeQL only
  if it introduces fingerprints not already in the on-disk baseline.
  Baseline lives on the `security-baseline` orphan branch, is
  refreshed automatically on `push: main`, and is protected against
  manual tampering by `baseline-guard.yml` (auto-revert + open
  issue). See ADR 0002.

#### Changed
- **Dependabot bumps**: `actions/labeler` 5.0.0 → 6.1.0 (#10),
  `step-security/harden-runner` 2.10.2 → 2.19.3 (#11),
  `github/codeql-action` SHA bump (#12),
  `actions/checkout` 4.2.2 → 6.0.2 (#13),
  `actions/setup-python` 5.3.0 → 6.2.0 (#14), all pinned to commit
  SHA per the project's supply-chain policy (ADR 0003).
- **Ratchet fingerprint strategy** (#20): swapped the CodeQL
  ratchet's `rule:file:line` fingerprints for SARIF
  `partialFingerprints.primaryLocationLineHash` so PRs that just
  shift lines no longer surface as "new findings", and added
  `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'` on the ratchet step so
  the `update-baseline` job can run on push without being blocked by
  the ratchet on main itself. Baseline schema bumped to `2`. See
  ADR 0008.
- **Scorecard SHA fix** (#22): the previous `ossf/scorecard-action`
  SHA was the annotated-tag object, not the commit it points to.
  Scorecard's webapp rejected it as an imposter commit, failing
  every push to main. Resolved to the real commit SHA.

#### Removed
- **Stray root-level packaging manifest** (#18): the obsolete
  `com.clipman.Clipman.json` at the repo root used the pre-rename
  app-id and was not referenced anywhere.

#### Docs
- Added `docs/adr/` with the first six MADR-format ADRs covering
  the decisions behind PRs #8, #15, #16, and #17 plus the project's
  branch-protection posture. See `docs/adr/README.md` for the index.
- Added `docs/releases/README.md` documenting where release notes
  live and how the release pipeline assembles them.
- Added a Mermaid architecture diagram under the **How It Works**
  section of `README.md` (#21).
- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1),
  `docs/development.md` (build/test/debug guide), and
  `docs/release-checklist.md` (release runbook).
- Added ADR 0008 (ratchet fingerprint strategy, documents #20) and
  ADR 0009 (weekly snap rebuild cadence, documents #9).
